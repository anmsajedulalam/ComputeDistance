# Computation-Of-Projectile-Trajectory
 Implementation of the theorems of projectile motion with python to calculate the distance. I used Python programming language here to measure the distance of two points of a projectile after giving the inputs of the angle and velocity of the object which is thrown. It will calculate the possible maximum and minimum distance of those two points according to the projectile theorems of Physics.
